# Mitzvah Scheduling

This is the *backend* of a scheduling webapp that automates and optimizes the scheduling of B'nai Mitzvot (BMs) for a synagogue with 120 BMs per year. The client has three potential venues, two of which are in use each weekend; students who attend the same academic school should not have BMs on the same date unless it is a shared ceremony; parents can request not to have their child's BM on specific weeks, and even during specific blocks of weeks.

Currently set up to read a spreadsheet containing parent input regarding:

* Date preferred/available
* Venue preferred
* Whether a shared ceremony is possible
* Whether the child is a twin who will be sharing their ceremony

If you are a synagogue and would like to contact me regarding this work, please visit [my website](https://zsiegel92.github.io/) for my contact information. More complete documentation is [in the works](https://zsiegel92.github.io/mitzvah_writeup/Mitzvah.pdf).
